# Udacity_Project2
Flower image classifier

This is the second project in the Udacity data scientist nanodegree program. The description from their site is:
Implement an image classification application using a deep learning model on a dataset of images. You will then use the trained model to classify new images. First, you will develop your code in a Jupyter notebook, then convert it into a Python application that you will run from the command line of your system.

It classifies images of flowers.
